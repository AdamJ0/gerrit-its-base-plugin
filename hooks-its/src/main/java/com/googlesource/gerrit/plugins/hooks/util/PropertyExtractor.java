   * As events may relate to more that a single issue, and properties sets are

   * is not sufficient, and we need to return
   * {@code Collection<Collection<Property>>}. Using this approach, a

   *
   * <pre>
   *   (bug 4711) Fix treatment of special characters in title
   *
   *   This commit mitigates the effects of bug 42, but does not fix them.
   *

   * </pre>

   * <pre>
   *   issue: 4711
   *   association: subject
   *   event: PatchSetCreatedEvent
   * </pre>

   * and
   *
   * <pre>
   *   issue: 42
   *   association: body
   *   event: PatchSetCreatedEvent
   * </pre>
   *
   * Thereby, sites can choose to to cause different actions for different
   * issues associated to the same event. So in the above example, a comment
   * "mentioned in change 123" may be added for issue 42, and a comment
   * "fixed by change 123‚Äù may be added for issue 4711.
   *
   * @param event The event to extract property sets from.
   * @return sets of property sets extracted from the event.
